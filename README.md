#### Oops... I didn't see you there. Know a little about me.

## Public information

My name is Gabriel, but honestly, I prefer to be called Gabe, Pett, Gabi, Pettersson, Panttersson... Well, I do have a lot of nicknames.

I write from Maceió, Alagoas, a city in Brazil. But being honest too, I can't wait to move to Minas Gerais.

I'm evolving daily as a developer. In December 2022 it will be 1 year since I entered this fantastic world.

I'm so glad you're here. I hope that now we can be a little closer.

## Curiosities about me

* I was gold medal in chess at my school
* I've been passionate about music since I've known myself as a human being. Inspired by my father.

* As a developer, my biggest project will be to help as many people as possible. I want to develop a Software capable of teaching programming from scratch to advanced,
 and English for people with less financial conditions. But the Software will be public and very well structured.
